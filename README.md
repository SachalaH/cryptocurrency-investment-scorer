# finaly-year-project-crypto
This github repository consists of Group 30's Final year project "Cryptocurrency Investment Scorer".
It contains the code for the web app which executes the logic of our project.
We combine both sentimental analysis and machine learning algorithm in an appropriately weighted manner in order to give highly accurate results.
The web app is dynamic in nature and can predict the investability of 3 major cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Matic and Ethereum) in real time.
The scorer uses a gauge-meter for visualizing the investability and also predicts the average price of the cryptocurrency for the next five-days.
The recommendation is either buy or sell, based on whether the price is rising or dropping within the next five days.
Additionally the current price of the 3 cryptocurrencies is also given for the sake of information.
